# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
